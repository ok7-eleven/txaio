Description: Compatibility API between asyncio/Twisted/Trollius
 .
 ``txaio`` is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on
 both Twisted and asyncio.
 .
 This is like `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_, but for wrapping
 over differences between Twisted and asyncio so one can write code
 that runs unmodified on both (*aka* "source code compatibility"). In
 other words: your users can choose if they want asyncio **or** Twisted
 as a dependency.
 .
     Note that, with this approach, user code runs under the native
     event loop of either Twisted or asyncio. This is different from
     attaching either one's event loop to the other using some event
     loop adapter.
 .
